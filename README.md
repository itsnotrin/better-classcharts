## Why
I'm beyond tired of people complaining that ClassCharts is too different to ShowMyHomework (Our old system), I agree with them though, which is why I'm making this...

## How
I'll use React Native for it's one code supports all nature to make my life far easier while developing for multiple platforms, I'll use the classcharts api to get the information needed (homework and when it's due, detentions/negative points and the reason and much more), I'll use my prior knowledge of the ShowMyHomework app and screenshots to create the layout.
